== Getting Started

=== Using Docker

The fastest way of checking Matter is to use its docker image:

[source, shell]
----
docker run -p 8888:8888 com.github.grooviter/matter:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
----

Of course if you would like to keep your Jupyter notebooks once the container has stopped, you should map your local directory to the work directory inside the Matter container. In the following example we are mapping the current local directory **$(pwd)** to the work directory inside Jupyter:

[source, shell]
----
docker run \
    -p 8888:8888 \
    -v $(pwd):/home/juvyan/work \
    com.github.grooviter/matter:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
