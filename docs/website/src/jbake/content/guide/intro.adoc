== Intro

**Matter** is a https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html[Jupyter Kernel] 
for the https://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy language]. 

**Matter** was born as a fork of the http://beakerx.com/[Beakerx] project. Although the 
BeakerX project is a great project, Matter wants to focus on the Groovy language. 
It tries to integrate several analytic and machine learning JVM libraries together to 
create a common developer experience using the Groovy language syntax as entry point.

WARNING: You have to be careful when doing this type of things it you'd like to survive

To give you a hint about how is to develop with Matter lets take Tablesaw as an
example. Tablesaw is one of the libraries integrated with Matter. The following
snippet is taken from the Tablesaw page. It shows how to filter a series of 
tornadoes chaining specific criterias:

NOTE: This is just a note to keep in mind

[source, java]
----
import com.github.tablesaw.api.Table

Table tornadoes = Table.read().csv('tornadoes.csv')
Table result = tornadoes.where(tornadoes.intColumn("Fatalities").isGreaterThan(0));
result = tornadoes.where(result.dateColumn("Date").isInApril());

result = tornadoes.where(
    result
        .intColumn("Width")
        .isGreaterThan(300) // 300 yards
        .or(result.doubleColumn("Length").isGreaterThan(10))); 
----

And then you can find the same code using Groovy list syntax. Underneath Matter is using
the same API but with a shorter concise way.

[source, groovy]
.Groovy code
----
import com.github.grooviter.matter.Matter as mt

tornadoes = mt.read.csv('tornadoes.csv', sep=';')
criterias = tornadoes['Fatalities'] > 0 & tornadoes['Date'] in [Month.APRIL] & tornadoes['Width'] > 300
tornadoes = tornadoes[criterias | tornadoes['Length'] > 10]
----

The same way Matter tries to cover the following topics:

IMPORTANT: This is a very important part you have to take care
